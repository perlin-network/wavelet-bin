# Executables

The Perlin Wavelet project comes with several wrappers/executables.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`wavelet`** | The main Wavelet CLI client. It allows running a testnet node (private network), and used by other processes to access the network. Refer to the [Wavelet CLI][wiki-wavelet-cli] wiki page for command line options. |
| `wctl` | Utility tool to interact with a Wavelet client. Please see our [wctl wiki page][wiki-wctl] for details. |

# Getting Started

To get started running Wavelet, download one of the pre-built release binaries from our [GitHub releases][github-releases] page. We currently support Linux and OSX. Support for Windows coming soon.

## Quickstart

To test Wavelet on a local cluster, run the following commands in 2 terminals.

```shell
[terminal 1] > ./wavelet --port 3000 --db.path testdb_1 --api.port 9000
[terminal 2] > ./wavelet --port 3001 --db.path testdb_2 \
    --privkey 25eef1345af9a2ce93e7ca5623224913b64b71ac314480902c1ec3bdba8b7537e6bb44e8ae761d9793f6941929dbf81f5727b698945746e5f3233b0ee0e83be7 \
    --peers tcp://localhost:3000
```

To send a transaction, type the following command into terminal 1: `p e6bb44e8ae761d9793f6941929dbf81f5727b698945746e5f3233b0ee0e83be7 5`. This sends 5 PERLs (Perlin tokens) to the second client.

```shell
> Enter a message: p e6bb44e8ae761d9793f6941929dbf81f5727b698945746e5f3233b0ee0e83be7 5

## Running Wavelet

Starting Wavelet with no arguments will launch the client with the default settings listening for connections on port 3000. It saves ledger state data to directory `testdb`.

```shell
> ./wavelet

## Configuration file

As an alternative to passing the flags to the `wavelet` binary, you can also pass a configuration file. For all configuration options, refer to the [Configuration file][wiki-wavelet-configuration-file] section of the wiki.

```shell
> ./wavelet --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

## Interacting with Wavelet

You can interact with Wavelet in several ways.

### Directly through the client

In the Wavelet command line mode, you can directly enter commands through the console. The following is a list of supported commands.

```shell
`w`: to view your wallet
`p <public key> <amount>`: to pay a wallet with the specified public key
`a <public key>`: to view the balance of another account
```

### Programatically using wctl

With the `wctl` application, you can send remote API commands to a Wavelet client if the API option is enabled. Refer to the [wctl wiki page][wiki-wctl] for usage instructions.

```shell
> ./wctl send_transaction --remote ${API_HOST}:${API_PORT} \
    --privkey ${API_KEY} \
    transfer '{"recipient": "${PUBLIC_KEY}", "amount": ${AMOUNT}}'
```

### Web UI
